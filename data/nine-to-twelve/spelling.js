  "The child shows almost equal ability between oral & written expression (is not better at oral work than the written output)?",
  "Can the child retain & use grammar rules? (no repeated teaching of plurals, spelling rules required)?",
  "Can the child’s writing keep to the same use of tense in the same story / essay / composition (not shifting tenses like ‘I was walking down the street yesterday and I need to go to the shop to buy milk’)?",
  "Does the child show realistic expectations of performance in assignments / tests (not say he has done well and then achieve less marks than expected)?",
